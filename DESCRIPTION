Description: Matches cases to controls based on genotype principle components (PC). 
      In order to produce better results, matches are based on the weighted 
      distance of PCs where the weights are equal to the % variance explained 
      by that PC. A weighted Mahalanobis distance metric (Kidd et al. (1987)
      <DOI: 10.1016/0031-3203(87)90066-5>) is used to determine matches.
